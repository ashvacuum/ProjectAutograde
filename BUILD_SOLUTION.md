# Build Issues Resolution

## Problem
The original build was failing due to Windows permission issues with symbolic links in the electron-builder code signing process:

```
ERROR: Cannot create symbolic link : A required privilege is not held by the client.
```

## Root Cause
- electron-builder tries to extract code signing tools that contain symbolic links
- Windows requires administrator privileges or Developer Mode to create symbolic links
- The winCodeSign extraction process was failing repeatedly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Fixed security vulnerabilities by updating Electron to v38.1.2
- Added missing dependencies: simple-git, js-yaml, csv-writer, jspdf

### 2. Alternative Build Method
Switched from electron-builder to electron-packager:

```bash
# Working build command
npm run package-win

# Or directly:
npx electron-packager . unity-auto-grader --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist --overwrite --prune=true
```

### 3. Updated Build Scripts
- Modified `build-windows.bat` to use electron-packager
- Added fallback methods in case of build failures
- Added `package-win` script to package.json

## Build Status: ✅ WORKING

### Current Working Commands:
```bash
# Development mode (immediate testing)
npm start

# Build portable executable
npm run package-win

# Automated build script
build-windows.bat
```

### Build Output:
- Location: `dist\unity-auto-grader-win32-x64\`
- Executable: `unity-auto-grader.exe`
- Type: Portable application (no installer needed)

## Application Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL

The application successfully:
- Starts the Electron window
- Initializes the Express server on port 3001
- Loads Claude Code integration
- Displays the Discord-like UI

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)

### Option A: Enable Developer Mode
Run as Administrator in PowerShell:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock" -Name "AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

### Option B: Clear Cache and Retry
```bash
rmdir /s /q "%LOCALAPPDATA%\electron-builder\Cache\winCodeSign"
npm run build-win
```

### Option C: Use Alternative Packager
```bash
npm install @electron/packager --save-dev
npx @electron/packager . unity-auto-grader --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist --overwrite
```

## Recommendation
Continue using electron-packager for Windows builds as it:
- Avoids code signing complexity
- Creates portable executables
- Has fewer permission requirements
- Works reliably across different Windows configurations

The current build creates a fully functional portable application that can be distributed without installation requirements.
