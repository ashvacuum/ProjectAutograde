## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **LLM API Key** - At least one of: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, Cohere, Azure OpenAI
- **Canvas LMS Access** - API token required (instructor/TA permissions)
- **Git** - For repository operations (must be in system PATH)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Open a command prompt in the project directory**
3. **Run the Windows build script:**
   ```bash
   build-windows.bat
   ```
   This will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Build the Windows executable
   - Create an installer in the `dist` folder

### 1b. Development & Testing

For testing and debugging, use these batch files:

- **`start-debug.bat`** - **RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING**
  - Opens DevTools automatically
  - Enables verbose logging to console
  - Shows detailed grading progress
  - Perfect for troubleshooting

- **`start-dev.bat`** - Development mode
  - Standard development environment
  - DevTools available (F12)
  - Some logging enabled

- **`npm start`** - Production mode
  - Minimal logging
  - No DevTools by default

### 2. Configuration (Optional - Environment Variables)

The app stores credentials securely in electron-store, but you can also use environment variables as a fallback:

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file with your settings:**
   ```env
   CANVAS_API_URL=https://your-school.instructure.com/api/v1
   CANVAS_TOKEN=your_canvas_api_token_here
   # or use: CANVAS_API_KEY=your_canvas_api_token_here (both work)
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   ```

**Note**: Credentials entered in the UI take precedence over `.env` values. The `.env` file is only used as a fallback if no credentials are stored in electron-store.

### 3. First Time Setup

1. **Launch the application** (run `npm start` or use built executable)
2. **Navigate to "Settings"** panel and add your LLM API key (OpenAI, Claude, or other)
3. **Navigate to "Canvas Setup"** and enter your Canvas credentials
4. **Go to "Criteria"** panel and load the default Unity math templates
5. **Verify LLM status** shows as "Available" in the Dashboard

## üéÆ Usage Workflow

### Standard Grading Process

1. **Connect to Canvas** - Set up your Canvas API credentials in Canvas Setup panel
2. **Select Course** - Go to Assignments panel, choose the course containing Unity assignments
3. **Choose Assignment** - Click "Grade" on the assignment you want to grade
4. **Review Submissions** - App shows all submissions with GitHub URLs
5. **Configure Criteria** - Select grading criteria template (or use default)
6. **Start Batch Grading** - Click "Start Batch Grading" button. App will:
   - Clone each GitHub repository to temp directory
   - Validate Unity project structure (Assets, ProjectSettings folders)
   - Analyze C# scripts for Unity patterns and math concepts
   - Send analysis to LLM with rubric and assignment context
   - Receive structured grading with feedback
   - Clean up temp files
7. **Review Results** - Go to Results panel to:
   - View detailed grades and feedback for each student
   - Handle submissions flagged for instructor review
   - Post grades to Canvas
   - Export results to CSV/JSON/PDF

### Minimal Workflow (No Build)
- Pulls GitHub repositories
- Analyzes code without compilation
- Grades based on code structure and math usage
- Cleans up temporary files automatically
