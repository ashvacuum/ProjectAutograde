## üìñ Detailed User Guide

### How Grading Works

AraLaro follows this workflow:

1. **Repository Cloning**: Downloads student's GitHub repository to a temporary folder
2. **Project Validation**: Verifies the repository is a valid Unity project (checks for Assets and ProjectSettings folders)
3. **Script Analysis**: Analyzes all C# scripts for Unity-specific patterns and math concepts
4. **LLM Grading**: Sends code analysis to your configured LLM with assignment criteria
5. **Feedback Generation**: Receives structured grades with detailed feedback
6. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after grading

### Grading Criteria Explained

The app uses weighted scoring across multiple criteria categories:

- **Unity Math Concepts**: Vector operations, quaternions, transforms, physics, trigonometry, interpolation
- **Code Quality**: MonoBehaviour structure, performance, naming conventions, error handling, organization
- **Custom Criteria**: Create your own criteria based on assignment requirements

Each criterion has:
- **Name**: What you're grading
- **Weight**: Points allocated (e.g., 25 points)
- **Description**: What to look for in student code

### Canvas Integration

#### Posting Grades
- Grades are posted individually or in batch
- Includes both numerical score and detailed text feedback
- Comments appear in Canvas gradebook for students to review

#### Required Permissions
Your Canvas API token must have:
- Read course content
- Read and write grades
- Read user information
- Read assignment submissions

### Export Options

**CSV Export**: Spreadsheet format for gradebook integration
- Student name, email, score, feedback
- Importable into Excel or Google Sheets

**JSON Export**: Machine-readable format for data analysis
- Complete grading results with metadata
- Useful for custom reporting tools

**PDF Export**: Professional grade reports
- Student name and submission details
- Score breakdown by criteria
- Detailed feedback and code examples
- Suitable for student records

## üéì Understanding the Grading Process

### What Students Need to Submit
Students must submit GitHub repository URLs through Canvas. The repository should contain:
- A valid Unity project structure (Assets and ProjectSettings folders)
- C# scripts implementing the assigned math concepts
- Public repository or provide GitHub access token

### What AraLaro Analyzes
The grading engine looks for:
- **Unity Patterns**: Proper use of MonoBehaviour, lifecycle methods (Start, Update, FixedUpdate)
- **Math Concepts**: Vector operations, quaternion rotations, physics calculations
- **Code Quality**: Naming conventions, error handling, performance optimization
- **Best Practices**: SerializeField usage, component references, code organization

### Grading is Code-Based Only
Important: AraLaro performs **static code analysis** only
- Does NOT compile or run Unity projects
- Does NOT test gameplay functionality
- Analyzes C# code structure and patterns
- Best for grading math implementation and code quality

- **Physics Integration** (15 pts) - Rigidbody forces and collision detection
- **Trigonometry** (10 pts) - Sin/cos applications and angle calculations
- **Interpolation** (10 pts) - Lerp, Slerp, and smooth transitions

### Code Quality Criteria
